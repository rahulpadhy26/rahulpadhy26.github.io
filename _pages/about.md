Hello everyone, this is Rahul Padhy. I'm currently working as a Software Developer 2 / Member of Technical Staff at Oracle, Bengaluru. In Oracle, I've worked on Clustering, Graph Analytics, Code-Coverage and overhauling of certain legacy systems.

When I'm not in work, I explore various areas in Computer Science.



My Background and History
-------------------------

I completed my Bachelors' in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela in 2018. Prior to working at Oracle, I was an Associate Software Engineer at Veritas Technologies LLC, Pune, where I worked on designing end-to-end test suites for the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and the CIFS-ACL protocol in the product Veritas Access.
